Home Automation Device

This is a project to build a home automation device using ESP8266 NodeMCU Module. The device will be able to control the lights, fans, AC, TV, etc. using a mobile app, web app, telegram and even Google Voice assistance. The device will also be able to detect the temperature and humidity of the room and control the AC accordingly. The device will also track the water level (percentage) in water tank.
